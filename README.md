# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

The banking industry disruptor in spotlight is Wise or previously known as TransferWise. 

Wise is an emerging alternative international payment service to traditional banking instruments. They was created in 2011 by Estonians, Kristo Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus. Both were friends in similar circumstances. 

Taavet was employed at Skype, lived in London, got paid in Euros but required pounds for living expenses. Kristo worked for Deloitte, also lived in London, and got paid in pounds but had a mortgage in euros back in Estonia. They both had to pay expensive fees and use bad exchange rates through their banks so naturally they come to a workaround. Each month, they looked up the real exchange rate on Reuters. Taavet put his euros into Kristo’s Estonian bank account, and Kristo topped up Taavet’s UK account with his pounds. Both got the currency they needed almost instantly, and neither paid an extra cent on bad exchange rates or unreasonable charges. There was no waiting, no stress, and no extra cost. ‘There must be others like us…’ they thought. So they started a company, called it TransferWise, and hired a team to build the best way to send money between countries. 

Wise has had several funding rounds privately to date, some renowned investors include Andreessen Horowitz, JP Morgan, Sir Richard Branson, Max Levchin. Their most recent completed round of funding came to $319 million USD in 2020 that valued the company at $5 billion USD and is on course to launch an initial public offering in May 2021.

## Business Activities:

Wise was created to solve a global problem where international transactions meant incurring expensive hidden fees. Moreover, Kristo and Taavet has also been using Wise as a platform to campaigning against banks and brokers hiding fees.They found that while banks often claimed to offer free money transfers with no commission, in reality they were charging hidden fees, often by adjusting the exchange rate they offered. This meant the customer lost out every time they transferred money (markbprince.com, 2021). In 2014, when CEO Kristo Käärmann told the Chairman of the UK regulator that banks should reveal all their charges, he was met with laughter. In response, they demonstrated this level of transparency they were fighting for (twitter.com, 2021).

Wise does not discriminate when it comes to their customers, from the grandma in rural Australia that sends her grandchildren birthday money in Ireland to the local business that sell want to internationally, Wise has an operating model for every user. It bypasses pricey international payments entirely by using two local transfers instead of one international transaction. If you want to convert your pounds to euros, you send the money in pounds to its UK-based account (stackshare, 2021). Wise operates currency exchange in a transparent way, meaning you can always refer to their website to see exactly what current exchange rates. Not only that, they also link current currency rates posted on major search engines on their website for your reference in real time. The lack of hidden fees coupled with their approach to fee transparency allows them to be competitive, attracting customers away from expensive and traditional forms of international payments.


## Competitive Advantage and Landscape:

Wise is a part of a growing FinTech-centric group of companies that are disrupting the payments sector of the financial industry. This space has an upwards trend of quicker transactions, increased competitive pricing and transition towards FinTech companies taking a larger market share of the sector. With over 200,00 business accounts and 10 million people transacting over 4.5 billion pounds per month, Wise has distinguished itself as a home-known brand that customers trust and will continue to grow to be a bigger player in the sector.This was a snapshot taken in August 2017, in contrast with transfer volumes reported last year they would only have been lagging behind Western Union in terms of cross-border money transfer volume by company.

Wise's competitors include companies in the financial, banking, payments and FinTech sector as they essentially operate within these sectors. Companies that are most similar in comparison to Wise however are those that also identify themselves in all the sectors that Wise is categorised in which include OFX, InstaRem, OrbitRemit, TorFX, WorldRemit. Another reason Wise is considered a major company in its own right is because it leads its competitors in the amount of currencies it operates at over 55 currencies. 

Interestingly, as companies try to hide as much information as they can from consumers, Wise publishes the breakdown of the fees they charge consumers as you land in their web page. The ethos and principles projected by the founders is imminent in the way Wise presents itself and gives consumers a chance to connect with the brand. They believe in being radically transparent and honest about their fees and profits, actively charging as little as possible and making premium the standard way of procedure.




## Recommendations

An apparent consumer shift in technological adoption in mobile devices means that companies must adopt a sustainable and simple mobile application that supports their business model. One can't help but feel that Wise is lacking in the marketing side of their mobile application and pushing for market share in mobile convenience when it comes to international transactions. Investing in the mobile UX will pay dividends as more consumers reliably transact over the their phones without the need of a computer. 

Wise's development team should also actively expand and penetrate towards collaboration with Neo-banks as they have done with Up bank in Australia. This will prove lucrative as Neo-banks including Up bank that uses other major banks' Banking as a Service to operate might not want to adopt the major banks' expensive international payment options. In turn, there is now a market for Wise to expand into the international payment sector of Neo banks, essentially taking away a larger market share of international payments from major banks.
